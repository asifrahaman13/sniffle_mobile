# Getting Started

This is the mobile application repository for healthcare management. Users can have end to end recommendation, data entry, data, graphs of their healthcare data over mobile device. Backend is done through FastAPI server. The backend repository can be found here: 

https://github.com/asifrahaman13/sniffle_backend.git

***You must run the backend repository to run this application.***

***However you can also try using the hosted backend url. If that works you do not need to run the backend repository locally**

## Clone

First clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asifrahaman13/sniffle_mobile
```

Next go to the root directory.

```bash
cd sniffle_mobile/
```


## Note 

**Before you start the application please start the backend application.**


Hit the following URL.

```bash
https://sniffle-backend.onrender.com
```

Wait for ~1 min. If you see success message then you do not need to run the local backend repository.

```bash
{
  "status": "The server is running as expected."
}
```

You can use the following credentials in the .env file.

```bash
WEBSOCKET_URI=wss://sniffle-backend.onrender.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="314990641802-5493c8cba51aqd8kgnqquvlma3o2r637.apps.googleusercontent.com"
BACKEND_URI="https://sniffle-backend.onrender.com"
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
```

However if the backend url is not healthy you need to run the backend server locally.

Note that the backend should be running. The backend repository can be found here: https://github.com/asifrahaman13/sniffle_backend.git.

You should enter the following data in your .env file of this application.

```bash
WEBSOCKET_URI=ws://localhost:8000
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="314990641802-5493c8cba51aqd8kgnqquvlma3o2r637.apps.googleusercontent.com"
BACKEND_URI="http://localhost:8000"
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=
```


## Step 1: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn run android
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project: [yarn is recommended]

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn run start
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
